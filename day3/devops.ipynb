We could add or remove files from the stage before we store them in the repository. To store our staged changes we run the commit command with a message describing what we've changed. Files can be changed back to how they were at the last commit by using the command: \n",

    "git commit -m \"I modified the hello function\"\n",

The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready, and now we're ready. So let's push our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of our remote is \"origin\" and the default local branch name is \"master\". The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Go ahead and push it!\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**pull** Let's pretend some time has passed. We've invited other people to our GitHub project who have pulled your changes, made their own commits, and pushed them. We can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes by running pull. Let's take a look at what is  different from our last commit by using the git diff command. In this case we want the diff of our most recent commit, which we can refer to using the HEAD pointer. diff can also be used for files newly staged.\n",

Branching often allows you to track changes.\n",

After making your changes on the branch you just need to switch back to the master branch so you can copy (or merge) your changes from the branch back into the master branch.
