    "\n",
    "- De novo assembly. Use when you have no reference genome, or very poor annotations for it. Assembly will be difficult and incomplete.\n",
    "- Genome mapping. You might discover novel transcribed regions, especially useful to find gene models for species without annotations. Difficult to obtain accurate transcript expression estimates.\n",
