Figure out a test method, or use this one: compute zscores for every gene across the samples (row based zscores). Add the zscores for all the genes belonging to a group and order the samples by the cumulative zscores. (Normally it would require a high average and low variance, or a cummulative significance study, but a simple ordering will do)\n",
