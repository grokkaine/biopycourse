    "This course is intended to be interactive (you will learn by doing things in groups and by watching me do it live and talking about it). I will use Jupyter, an environment that allows us to do everything in real time on the browser, so you will work locally on your computer and my working is visible on the projected screen. It basically allows you to take your own notes on the lecture notes, and run/modify the programs on your lecture notes. You will receive the course material before the course starts.\n",

    "This is a short course that introduces the participants to using Python in the broad fields of molecular biology and biochemistry. It was designed to be done in less than a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "- day 1: tech intros, standard python (the advanced bits), handling data and plots\n",
    "- day 2: scientific computing, statistics and machine learning\n",
    "- day 3: deep learning and data engineering\n",
    "- day 4: free day, trip, dinner\n",
    "- day 5: choose a task or get help with your project\n",

    "**Some defensive statements**\n",
    "- Contrary to kids, who take life as it comes, adults have expectations.\n",
    "- I lacked the time to prepare the environment and managing our environment is a very useful exercise for everyone. Thus, we will do it together!\n",
    "- Some slides are antiquated and some are new and cool. Bear with me!\n",
    "- The course was not intended for an online audience, and while we made some efforts it is still in a transit state.\n",
    "- So far it was a one man show, with invited speakers and teaching assistants, please do not compare it to your favorite mega-course.\n",
    "- \"I could not finish the task\" This is sometimes intended by design, you will have a better idea about your limits if you test them.\n",
    "- \"I did not understand this\" It is fine to ask anytime if of general interest, but use the hackmd and slack channel otherwise.\n",
    "- This course will not guarantee you will be an advanced programmer in three days. Today learning to program is as important as learning to write. But it takes years to become a good programmer. What is important is to persevere!\n",
    "- \"I came here *only* because I was interested in subject_X and I barely touched the surface!\" NBIS/SciLifeLab/Elixir offers short targeted courses on a large ranged to subjects, where you have the chance to apply. But will you know what you need if you did not attended this course?\n"

    "We expect you to work in fields related to molecular biology and biochemistry, but more distant studies of ecology and clinical medicine are of course welcome.

    "- people that learned basic Python and have difficulties doing anything, because a language is also a technology\n",

    "- people that need to program a tool or a library but lack the ability or want to become more efficient\n",
