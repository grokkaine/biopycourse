    "#### A short history\n",
    "\n",
    "The first programming languages had a concise syntax and were able to control the computer at a very low level. The best surviving dino from that era is probably C, a language that allows you to directly control the memory registry that the processor is using. In time as software accumulated and the IT infrastructure evolved languages became specialized, whith languages like C++ and Java controlling the core infrastructure sector while niche languages such as Matlab, R and others were being employed in engineering, statistics respectively. Meanwhile, languages became more distant to the hardware, becoming interpreted by a an engine that lies between the operating system and the program itself. Languages that are ready to run the moment writing stops are commonly called scripting languages. Another important changed occured in the manner data structures are managed, some languages alowing the type of an object to be verified and changed during runtime. These are called dynamic languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rise of the scripting languages\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to explain why scripting languages became so ubiquitous. It has to do with the lack of time and with safety. In C it is relatively easy to make mistakes that can damage a hardware, it takes more time to do something if you are not skilled and you write ugly code if you are not talented. The general purpose languages that stood out were Perl and Python. However, Perl came first and had an intently obfuscated syntax - this is because it was primarily adressed to UNIX system programmers, who love syntax puzzles and text obfuscation. Many sequencing libraries were developed into or integrated Perl, notable being BioPerl. R also developed as an opensource alternative to SAS, a language used in statistics. When Python started Perl dominated text processing, Matlab dominated engineering, R dominated open source statistics computing and Javascript dominated the web. But Python was adressed to everyone, and in a decade became the number one scripting language in terms of popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Future\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not trying to speculate, the point of Python was made, today older languages are revamping with Python features, while newer languages develop that are grown from Python concepts and will ultimately compete for broad audiences. I myself programmed in 30 different languages or more and I kept my sanity so there is no reason for alarm. Python is probably the best introduction to programming at this moment in time, which is why most universities and schools are including it as the main tool in their curricula."

    "## As a new \"pythonista\", who will be your friends?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist working in biology, or as a biologist working with data science, calling Python at a party brings with it a few friends, which I recommend you get to know in time, or maybe some of them are already familiar? The mistake of the beginer is to think he knows programming after a three day course. The following list should not discourage you, in three days you will already be able to do what programmers spend most of their time with, and maybe free some of them for more important work or put them out of work entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R. It is hard to extract your data if you avoid R. Many Python fans complain of R's byzantine syntax, or quote what R experts say, that R is a plaftorm with a language instead of the opposite. This is all true of course, but keep in mind that R just like Python has the real programming done in C, while most of the best libraries are also compiled from C. Much of the bioinformatics toolset today is found in R, and Python is a perfect glue for R calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C. No matter how good computers become, core stuff will always need to run fast and not hog on resources. C is the mother of most software including the interpreters for most scri√•ting languages. The best Python libraries for scientific computing for example are mere calls to compiled C code. C is not as hard as it used to be. Notably Cython is a way to call C and C++ to and from Python. Swig is another language agnosting platform that makes it easy to design bindings for C code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perl. Perl is viewed as a dying language since the community migrated to Python but there is a lot of bioinformatics code writen in Perl. Some still think that Perl text processing is the best, and Perl is slightly more geekish and more natively integrated with the Unix toolset. It fits you better than Python if you hate the \"mainstream\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clouds and the newer langs. High performance ultra scallable computing is all the rage today and Python is struggling to keep up with younger languages that were designed with cloud computing, server farms and super clusters in mind. Have a go with some of the new kids on the block, such as GO, Scala, Julia, Closure, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java, C++, C#. Together these languages contain a lot of bioinformatics software. Most NGS sequencing programs and most data science programs are written in Java. Through Jython one can integrate Java classes with Python modules. Python claims it too but Java is probably the only platforms that can trully claim to come with \"baterries included\", since most of Python batteries are in C. C++ is originally an object oriented extension of C and Python can treat it with the same tools and C# is what Microsoft did when it felt that too many programers are abandoning Visual C++ for Java. The Microsoft clone of Python is called IronPython, in case you wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matlab. Most of the scientific computing software in Python is an open source version of Matlab libraries. Yes, Matlab is that good, if you can afford it. Matlab is still setting the trend in the field of numerical computation. For the poor, Octave is a free and open source alternative. SageMath is another popular collection of opensource libraries that includes most of Python scientific computing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Javascript. While Python dominates the multipurpose scripting languages, one scripting languages dominates the browsers and slowly makes its way into server-side scripting too. Javascript much like R is viewed with disgust by many programmers due to its semantic imperfections but a recent statistics claims that 70% of the world code is running on Javascript interpreter. I wrote this entire course in the browser using Jupyter without ever using a Python editor, and the only community that is as vibrant as Python's is probably the HTML5/.js community, that embraces the latest open web standards. Some claim operating systems are superfluous, and ChromeOS, running on Javascript is certainly there to prove it. In terms of data visualization and interactivity, .js does not have equal. It is a bit too fictional to imagine that .js will improve to defeat all languages, more likely it is that assemblers will make the entire question of languages irrelevant and people will use what comes handier and translate the code as it suits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linux. It is probably more suitable that I write open source and open hardware, but unfortunately Linux is the only OS that qualifies, although both Apple and Microsoft have been \"converted\" and release more and more core OS functionality as open source. Linux runs the most popular mobile OS (Android) and is native to the most popular PC gaming and home entertainment platform (Steam + SteamOS). Free and open source software such as Python, R, C, Java and Perl feels best with Linux. The same can be said about open hardware. The revolution Python created by lowering the bar in programming is currently undergoing in hardware. From RapsberyPi minicomputers to Arduino microcontrollers, architecture is opening up to the common people, and Python/Linux is their main development environment. It will not be long until researchers will sit at three day courses on how to assemble sequencers, PCR machines and mass-spec chambers from multipurpose parts.\n",
